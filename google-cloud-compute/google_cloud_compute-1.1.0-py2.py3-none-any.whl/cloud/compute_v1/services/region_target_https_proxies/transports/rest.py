class RegionTargetHttpsProxiesRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for RegionTargetHttpsProxies.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the RegionTargetHttpsProxiesRestTransport.

                A target HTTPS proxy is a component of GCP HTTPS load
                balancers. \* targetHttpsProxies are used by external
                HTTPS load balancers. \* regionTargetHttpsProxies are
                used by internal HTTPS load balancers. Forwarding rules
                reference a target HTTPS proxy, and the target proxy
                then references a URL map. For more information, read
                Using Target Proxies and Forwarding rule concepts.

                request (~.compute.SetUrlMapRegionTargetHttpsProxyRequest):
                    The request object. A request message for
                RegionTargetHttpsProxies.SetUrlMap. See
                the method description for details.

                retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                    should be retried.
                timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
                metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                    sent along with the request as metadata.

                    Represents an Operation resource. Google Compute Engine
                has three Operation resources: \*
                `Global </compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/globalOperations>`__
                \*
                `Regional </compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionOperations>`__

                `Zonal </compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/zoneOperations>`__
                You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous
                API requests. For more information, read Handling API
                responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zonalOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
